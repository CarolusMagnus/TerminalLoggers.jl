The default is to prefix with the log level and a suffix containing the module, file and line location.\nshow_limited limits the printing of large data structures to something which can fit on the screen by setting the :limit IOContext key during formatting.\nright_justify is the integer column which log metadata is right justified at. The default is zero (metadata goes on its own line).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#TerminalLoggers.StickyMessages","page":"Home","title":"TerminalLoggers.StickyMessages","text":"StickyMessages(io::IO; ansi_codes=io isa Base.TTY && !Sys.iswindows())\n\nA StickyMessages type manages the display of a set of persistent \"sticky\" messages in a terminal. That is, messages which are not part of the normal scrolling output. Each message is identified by a label and may may be added to the set using push!(messages, label=>msg), and removed using pop!(messages, label), or empty!().\n\nOnly a single StickyMessages object should be associated with a given TTY, as the object manipulates the terminal scrolling region.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"}]
